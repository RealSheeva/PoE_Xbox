This basic controller-input script made for Path Of Exile brings a basic-level of controller input to PC-PoE.

It isn't perfect, but I did what I could with it. Hopefully I'll come back to this project one day, but for now, you can contact me at:

Sticks_RT_Change -> Changes RT to be RCtrl, so the sub-menu can be used (if desired)
